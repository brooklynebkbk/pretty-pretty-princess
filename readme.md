Pretty Pretty Princess

My game is an online version of one of my favorite games growing up. The logic of the game is fairly similar. The object of the game is to collect each of the various peices of jewelry and be the first player to get the crown after first collecting the jewelry.

The code being presented is the MVP for this project. Here, there is one player and the object is to collect all of the jewelry without first landing on items that you cannot collect because they are either already in your possession or the crown before you have first collected the other peices 10 times during one game.

You start by hovering over the spinner, which starts the hand and click to stop the spinner. Given that you don't already have the item that you landed on, the peice will appear below the spinner to be dragged into the pile under player 1. You repeat this process until you win by collecting all of the peices of jewelry and finally the crown or you lose because you have proven to be unlucky and have landed on spaces that represent items that you already have or are not eligible to collect yet a total of 10 times. 

My game is comprised of several different files. I created the game from scratch using HTML and CSS and created a javascript file to allow game play and the ability to interact with the game. I also included two libraries, jquery and jquery-ui for manipukating the DOM.

The only real issue with the game in it's current state is that as you continue in the game and collect new items, the peices of jewelry to be dragged appear increasingly lower and lower on the screen. 

Some things that I would love to revisit and improve would be to allow multiple players, and the ability set up a player. The game would then be renamed from pretty pretty pile to pretty pretty prince or princess acordingly. With this game being retro and a board game that a lot of people havent heard of, there werent really any images to work from, so I would create these things from scratch. I think that this would be pretty rad to add a later time, but for this project, I wanted to focus more on the functionality. 

I have also included the drawing and planning for my game-play screen within the images folder.
